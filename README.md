# Arcade + Pop-Up Previewer

A lightweight tool to help build and preview Arcade expressions for ArcGIS Feature Services.

## ✅ Features

- Insert common Arcade snippets (rounding, formatting, Google Maps links).
- Build and preview custom pop-ups.
- Generate export-ready Arcade or HTML.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Paste a Feature Service REST endpoint (e.g., `https://.../FeatureServer/0`).
2. Click **Load Layer** to view fields and sample data.
3. Use the snippets, pop-up builder, and templates to craft your expression.
4. Copy and paste the generated Arcade into your ArcGIS pop-ups.
